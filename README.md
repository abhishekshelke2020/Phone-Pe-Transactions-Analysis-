PhonePe Transactions Analysis Dashboard

This project analyzes PhonePe transaction data to understand transaction trends, service wise performance, and failure patterns across a selected time period.

The dashboard provides a clear view of total transactions, successful and failed transactions, transaction amounts, and monthly trends. It also breaks down transaction amounts by services such as Loans, Insurance, Money Transfer, and Recharge & Bills, helping identify which services contribute the most value.

In addition, the project analyzes failed transaction reasons like server errors, wrong PIN, insufficient balance, incorrect information, and bank denials. This helps highlight common issues affecting transaction success and areas for improvement.
